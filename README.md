# My first split keyboard
Jan 31, 2024 - 

## Background
I wanted to solve the problem of shoulders and back curling when using a regular keyboard.  
I found out about the split keyboard and decided to make my own.

At first, I was going to choose a 4*6 layout.  
Because I thought separate number keys arranged in a row were necessary.  
And I tried to place the function(F1-F12) keys in a different layer on the number and other keys.

But I realized that the 3-column layout is more efficient.  
And I found out that I could arrange number keys and function keys like numpad on alpha keys using layer.  
So I chose 3*6 layout.

The reason I didn't choose the 3*5 layout is that it's difficult to use shortcuts if the modifier keys are not separated.

## Template
It should be **easy to make** because I am chobo(noob).  
So I selected [**cantor keyboard**](https://github.com/diepala/cantor)(Classic).

These are the factors I took into consideration when choosing a template.
1. Simple
2. Diodeless
3. Build guide

## Bill of materials
**Keyboard parts**
- 5x PCB (I only need 2x, but I can order more than 5x at jlcpcb)
